This folder contains all the data for the chatbot to work. The data for this example is downloaded from the location below,

https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/movie-recommender-systems/data

Name of the dataset - movies_metadata.csv

Since the dataset size is greater than 25MB, I provided only a snippet here. However, the exercise is built on the entire dataset obtained from the source. Please download the data from Kaggle and use it for your practice.

"metadata_prep.csv" will be created after you run the data preparation code which will be later used in nlp models to train the movie recommendation system. I have uploaded the sample of the data here (metadata_prep_sample.csv).
